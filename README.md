All weapons are Pack-a-Punchable and have been added to the mystery box.

### Weapons added to Tranzit:
#### Nuketown
- M27 - Assault Rifle
#### Mob of the Dead
- AK47 - Assault Rifle
- Thompson - Submachine Gun
- Uzi - Submachine Gun
- Death Machine - Special [Limited 1]
#### ORIGINS
- MP40 Adjustable Stock - Submachine Gun
- Scar-H - Assault Rifle
- MG08/15 - Light Machine Gun
- Skorpion EVO - Submachine Gun

*[Limited #] means can only be obtained by # person(s) from the mystery box*

### Upcoming updates
I'm planning to add more weapons from different maps to Tranzit. 
When that's all done I will probably make the mod bigger by adding support for other maps
